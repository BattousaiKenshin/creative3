    <h1>~~Welcome to the Library~~</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>The Library is currently stationed in your local town. </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, due to the horrible events caused by the corona virus, any patron is only allowed to take one copy of any given book, and is only able to put one copy on hold.</p>
    <p>Also unfortunately, there seems to be a need to limit the patrons to only 7 books per person.</p>
    <p>However, we do hope you enjoy your reading!</p>
